# go-learning
My small tours and tutorials to learn go, cause go goes brrrr

## [Go tour](https://tour.golang.org/list)
Official go tour for beginners, best to start with this
The codes can save you a bing :)

go-tour includes basic but important concepts of go programming
  - structs, slices and maps
  - methods and interfaces
  - goroutines and channels
  
## [xml-news-aggregator](https://pythonprogramming.net/go)
This is a beginner course with doing a "real" project
In this project, we use go to make a news aggregator using Washington Post sitemap

It seems Washington Post sitemaps takes 10 seconds to respond to go.Get() requests,
so It's slow fetching all the news (1 + 11 pages * 10 seconds is about 2 minutes just launching the server)

## [login-api](https://medium.com/@theShiva5/creating-simple-login-api-using-go-and-mongodb-9b3c1c775d2f)
This seems like a real project. In this project a basic Login api is built using go and jwt and mongo

Using postman and setting headers and body, we can register, login and fetch our profile
